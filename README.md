# MFE_course_Advanced_finance_time_series_analysis_2020

###### Hi, this repository is about the lecture "Advanced finance time series analysis" in KAIST MFE(Master of Financial Engineering) course. 
###### Honestly, I think it is not the course about time series, because it was just a new lecture, so this lecture couldn't find its own direction. 
###### But, there are so many useful information about the quantitative approach to finance.
