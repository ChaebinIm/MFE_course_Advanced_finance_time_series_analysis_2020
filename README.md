# MFE_course_Advanced_finance_time_series_analysis_2020

###### Hi, this repository is about the lecture "Advanced finance time series analysis" in KAIST MFE(Master of Financial Engineering) course. 
###### Honestly, I think it is not the course about time series, because it was just a new lecture, so this lecture couldn't find its own direction. 
###### But, there are so many useful information about the quantitative approach to finance.

######  This is the list of contents in this repository.

### 3. MFE542_HW3_ChaebinIm_20203884
### 4. MFE542_HW4_ChaebinIm_20203884
### 5. Final

###### I think you can easily know that these are the homeworks and final exam of this lecture. Yeah, It's right.
###### In each contents, you can easily find that there is a word file that is the definition of the homework(or exam), and there is a jupyter jupyter notebook file(.ipynb) or matlab file(.m) as an answer of the problem. You can refer it easily.
